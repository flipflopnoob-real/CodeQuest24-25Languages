# CodeQuest24-25Languages

As a summer project, I am going through Lockheed Martin's CodeQuest 2024 packet and attempting to complete each exercise in a unique language. As an added challenge, I am going to limit myself to looking only at the documentation for each of these languages and only using the standard library to avoid using other's code.

The List:
- Rust
- Swift
- Logo
- AutoIt
- VHDL
- Ada
- Groovy
- Pascal
- C++
- SAS
- Visual Basic
- OpenEdge ABL
- Python
- Perl
- Assembly
- Lua
- C
- C#
- PL/SQL
- ActionScript
- CoffeeScript
- FoxPro
- Scratch
- JavaScript
- Prolog
